# GAMEPLAY
### What is Gameplay?
Gameplay is a frontend for DosBox, DosBox-X, and Scumm. It lets you play MS-DOS games easily and quickly—no complications, no configuration needed. Just choose a game from the list and play. Everything is preconfigured (best audio, best graphics, extra parameters, etc.).<br>

### What games can I play?
Initially, there's a list of over 300 ready-to-play games. They include preview images, manuals, maps, and guides so you can enjoy the full game experience. No need to configure anything—not audio, not video—just enjoy.
### Can I add more games?
Of course! If you have favorite games that aren't on the list, you can easily and quickly add your own. In the advanced options, you can choose ZIP format, add a CD-ROM, change memory settings, video card, attach manuals, guides, maps, and more.
### What language is Gameplay in?
The language is detected automatically, and it selects between Spanish, English, German, French, and Italian. If none of these are detected, English is selected by default.
### Where can I download it?
There are two versions: the "executables only" version, which is the executable and the source code, which you can download right here by searching for the latest release. <br>
There's a full version, with all the games, images, manuals, maps, guides, and also the Windows executables for the emulators. The link is also in the release information.
### How can I contribute?
Easy—if you find a bug, just open an issue so it can be reviewed.
If you have games you’d like to add, better manuals, improved versions, etc., feel free to send them over.<br>
The source code is also available, so you can review it, compile it, and send me improvements or suggestions.
### I have Linux. Can I use it?
Absolutely! It works on Ubuntu, Fedora, etc. You’ll need to install the emulation engines beforehand, but it’s easy and explained in the manual. You can also compile it using Free Pascal.
### What about Mac users?
Gameplay has a version for Intel-based Macs (x86). There are a few setup steps, but it works well. Unfortunately, I don’t have access to a Mac with an ARM processor, but in theory, compiling the source code with Free Pascal should make it work.
